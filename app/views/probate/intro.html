 About this prototype
  </h1>
<p>This prototype is based on requirements captured from interviews with applicants and business needs from the probate registries.</p>
<p>It is the first step to create a simpler, streamlined online probate application process.<p>
<h2 class="heading-small">What this prototype covers</h2>
<p>This covers a simple personal application where:<p>
<ul class="list list-bullet">

<li>the applicant is one of two executors named in his mother’s will, the other executor is not applying</li>
<li>he has the death certificate and the original will, there are no codicils</li>
<li>his mother resided in England and was a widow</li>
<li>no inheritance tax was payable, the correct forms were completed online and he received an IHT identifier code.</li>
</ul>
<p ><em>For the purpose of testing this prototype please complete the form as if you are the personal applicant above.</em></p>
<h2 class="heading-small">What it doesn’t cover</h2>

More complex applications are not yet covered by this prototype. Areas that are not covered yet are greyed out, and will be added at a later date.
